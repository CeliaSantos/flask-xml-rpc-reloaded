Flask-XML-RPC-Re (Flask-XML-RPC-Reloaded)

This is a library that lets your Flask apps provide XML-RPC APIs. A small
example is included.

Flask-XML-RPC-Reloaded is a fork of the original Flask-XML-RPC, which was unfortuately abandoned.
This version should be 100% compatible and therefore a drop-in replacement for Flask-XML-RPC.
